# deft: Data Equipped with Fourier Transforms

**deft** is a C++ library providing Fourier-Transform-based tools for data on three-dimensional grids, including

  * various derivatives (various gradients, the Laplacian, etc.) computing using Fourier Transforms;
  * interpolation and filtering with Fourier Transforms;
  * sums of functions defined on a lattice.

**deft** includes a python wrapper. For example applications, see

  * example: [superpositions of functions on a lattice](/python/example.ipynb);
  * example: 

**deft** (currently) has several dependencies:

  * [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) (C++ library for linear algebra & scientific computing)
  * [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) ("Fastest Fourier Transform in the West")

**deft** is work in progress.
